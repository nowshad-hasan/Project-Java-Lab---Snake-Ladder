### About
Snake & Ladder :snake: is a simple game, made with :heart: for my Java Lab. It is also called `Shap Ludu` in Asia region. It's like - you
will try to climb up with the help of ladder but if you're in Snake position, then it'll move you in its tail. But its not up to you to get helped from
ladder or bitten by snake. Its all dependent on dice. Within the players who goes the **100** number position, will be **1st**, then **2nd**
, **3rd** and so on. But in our project you've to play only with the computer.
